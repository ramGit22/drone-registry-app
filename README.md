## NDZ Perimeter Violations Tracker
[Drone-registry-app](https://drone-map.netlify.app/)

A web app built with React that tracks drone pilots who violate the No-Drone-Zone (NDZ) perimeter around the endangered bird Monadikuikka's nest. The NDZ area is defined as a 100-meter radius around the nest.

# Purpose
The aim of this project is to monitor and prevent drone pilots from disturbing the delicate ecosystem and habitat of the Monadikuikka bird by providing a comprehensive list of those who violate the NDZ.
